<h3>The ReNew Canada Career Fair </h3><p> It is an event that will connect engineering firms who work on Canada’s Top 100 Infrastructure Projects with third and fourth-year engineering students looking to work with some of the most engaging and innovative firms operating in Canada. The event is scheduled to take place on January 30, 2024 at The Toronto Reference Library.</p>

<p>This event is not your typical career fair. Students will have the opportunity to attend a series of short presentations on innovative projects selected from ReNew Canada’s annual Top100 Projects report. Engineering firms will provide an overview of the projects, highlight innovations, demonstrate the role that engineers played in the project, and discuss specific opportunities – internships, co-op placements, and full-time careers available within their organizations. Students will have the opportunity to speak one-on-one with presenters and other engineering firms at their booths throughout the day </p>
